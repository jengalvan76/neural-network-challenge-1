Module 18 Challenge - Predict Student Loan Repayment
The scope of Module 18 Challenge included the following objectives to create a model to predict student loan repayment:
- Preprocessing data for use on a neural network model using StandardScaler, Train_Test_Split, etc.
- Compile and evaluate a model using a neural network i.e. TensorFlow Keras, etc.
- Predict loan repayment success by using your neural network model and referring to the Classificaton Report results
- Discuss creating a recommendation system for student loans and potential challenges
